## sleepwatcher_config

My configuration (LaunchDaemon plist file) and scripts for [Sleepwalker](http://osx.iusethis.com/app/sleepwatcher) by [Bernhard Baehr](http://www.bernhard-baehr.de/).

Rather basic, does what I want without any extras.

Sleepwatcher can be installed via MacPorts, BTW:

    sudo port install sleepwatcher


### Wake-up script (`sleepwatcher_wake`)

* Mounts the volumes on my external USB drive
* Starts Rivet.app


### Sleep script (`sleepwatcher_sleep`)

* Unmounts the volumes on my external USB drive
* Stops Rivet.app


### Instructions

    sudo launchctl load de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher.plist

and

    sudo launchctl unload de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher.plist


### Acknowledgements

The disk mount/unmount part of the scripts was looted from [a MacOSXHints tip](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20080329201951648).
